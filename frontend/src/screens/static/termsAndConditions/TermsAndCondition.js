								The "Fitness Factory" is a fully stocked gym run by a competent proprietor with knowledgeable trainers.
								It is highly advised for women looking for a respectable location for physical personal training, to
								maintain fitness and excellent health, as it is situated in the center of Galle Town. At Fitness
								Factory, monitoring clients, trainers, client meal plans, employee leave requests, and workouts are the
								key manual duties still being done. The existing management of the gym has generated several issues
								regarding efficiency, time wastage, and difficulty in managing members and personnel. For the gym, a
								suitable administration system was required. We have taken the initiative to design a gym administration
								system to address these concerns and complications that occur while performing jobs manually, from
								straightforward chores like making workout plans to significant tasks like managing personnel. The
								trainers, customers, and the owner will use the system as the system admin. Our primary goal in
								developing this system is to make things that were previously completed manually in the gym easier. The
								system's tasks are divided into several categories, including managing members, trainers, workouts,
								member meals, and employee leave. The efficiency of the tasks carried out in the gym can be increased
								thanks to this system, and we anticipate that all system users will benefit from better service
